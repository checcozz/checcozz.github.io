                <h1>Microsoft Machine Learning Course Summary</h1>
                <p>In this course i learned both theoretically and practically the basic machine learning’s algorithms and applied them in real case scenarios using Python. 
                    I learn to use useful libraries as Scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and matplotlib to solve complex problems ,develop machine learning algoritm and display results in accurate way. I also used cloud programming spaces as Google Colab and python tools as jupyter. 
                    During the course I challenge my knowledge in this different areas:</p>
            
                <h2>Data Analysis with ML </h2>
                <p>The bigger section of this course was about data analysis. At first I developed and applied different regression models to real datasets from the library sklearn.</p>
                
                <h4>Linear regression</h4>
                <p>The first assessment was to create a linear regression model to show the relationship between  diabetes progression and BMI in 442 patients considered. After created the model I trained it on the dataset using a method 70-30 to train and test. Then I plot the blue line result reported in the scatter plot below. 
                    To validate the model I also calculated the mean square error and the score of model determination.
                </p>

                <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
                <p>In this section I developed a logistic regression model to predict the colour depending on other variables applied to a dataset of pumpkin harvest in US. After preparing the dataset I plot the variables of my interest of the datased using seaborn library.  I encoded the category using both a ordinal econder and a categorical encoder and the class “LabelEncoder” of scikit-learn.
                    Before create the model I plot the data using a Swarm diagram (see picture) 
                    I buld the model and trained it with an 80-20 train test rule. I also print the f1 score and the classification report to analyse the precision of my prediction. (immagini) 
                    I also create a confusion matrix and a ROC curve to confirm the precision of my model.
                </p>

                <h4>Classification (supervised learning)</h4>
                <p>In these section I developed 4 different classifications algoritms to analise a dataset of world cusine dishes. The scope was to predict the country of the dish starting from a list of ingrediends in a precise way. A further development could be predict a possible dish someone can cook based on the food available. 
                    To prepare my data I used a balancing technique call SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE — Version 0.13.0.dev0 (imbalanced-learn.org)). 
                    Scikit -learn offers a series of algoritms to classify datas as :
                    <li>- Linear Models</li>
                    - Support Vector Machines
                    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
                    - Nearest Neighbors
                    - Gaussian Processes
                    - Decision Trees
                    - Ensemble methods (voting Classifier)
                    - Multiclass and multioutput algorithms (multiclass and multilabel classification, multiclass-multioutput classification)
                    Looking at the dataset structure and type of data I applied the following algorithms.
                    Linear SVC classifier. (immagini codice + score matrix) 
                    K-Neighbors classifier. (immagini codice + score matrix)
                    Support Vector classifier. (immagini codice + score matrix)
                    Ensemble Classifiers
                    At the end i create my own model and save it with Onnx.
